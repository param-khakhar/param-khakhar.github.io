<p>I am currently a Computer Science and Engineering Junior Undergrad studying at the Indian Institution of Technology, Delhi. Being a CSE student, I have been introduced to several interesting areas where CS is used but personally, I like designing real-world applications using algorithms and data structures. Other areas which I am interested but haven’t explored much yet are finance, economics, history and biology.</p>

<p>The content of the articles would mainly be my experiences and other things which I found very interesting. You may find some CS articles wherein, I would write some stuff which is complex for me, in simple words, as an aid for me and might be for others too. There are different personal and professional goals which I had set earlier. I was able to achieve some and wasn’t able to do so with the others, however, in the process of achieving my goals I did make several mistakes but with perseverance I did make it to the finish line. It might turn out that there are others as well who are pursuing goals similar to mine. If not a generic overview, I can definitely tell others about the mistakes which I made, and help them prevent doing that. The scenario is also true vice versa where I am pursuing a particular goal and I do look out for experiences of others. Well, I think it’s the purpose of existence of life, and kind of similar to evolution.</p>

<p>I am from Rajkot, Gujarat, India. My hobbies include playing sports such as soccer, cricket, badminton, and basketball. Apart from that I mainly spend time watching soccer. Manchester is Blue! I try to watch as many Man City games as possible in a season irregardless of what IST time are they taking place. It’s about 7 years since I started actively following soccer and probably you can guess why I am a Mancunian. I just love the way they play.</p>

<p>Apart from watching Man City play, I do listen to music. I don’t fancy any particular genres as such but there are certain artists/bands such as Imagine Dragons, Ed Sheeran, Arijit Singh, Kishore Kumar which I like very much. Also the music I listen depends on my mood :P</p>

<p>I do like to watch movies, mainly action, sci-fi and comedies but am also enjoying rom-coms and family drama lately. I am not a trained dancer but like to dance whenever there’s an opportunity :D. I also like to travel and visit new places, and the aim is to cover as much as possible!</p>
