I"À<p>Here, Iâ€™d like to share some of the quotes which I encountered throughout my readings and also as an advice by the elders.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And once the storm is over, you wonâ€™t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You wonâ€™t even be sure whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you wonâ€™t be the same person who walked in. Thatâ€™s what this stormâ€™s all about</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the cost of lies? Itâ€™s not that weâ€™ll mistake them for the truth. The real danger is that if we hear enough lies, then we no longer recogize the truth at all.</p>

  <p>Celebrate your efforts, rather than the results.</p>
