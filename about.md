Consider the following situation,

You are looking for a hospital for the treatment of someone elderly in your family. There are two prominent choices available, Hospital A and Hospital B. For the last 1000 patients the patients which got treated from Hospital A had a survival rate of 90% whereas those which got treated from Hospital B had survival rate of 80%. So, Hospital A seems to be a clear winner right? Well it may not be the case.

One shouldn't ignore the fact that all the patients which arrive at the hospital do have same health level. For example we can classify the patients having good health and bad health repectively. Let the number of survival rates of the patients considering the above classification scheme be as follows:

Hospital A - 900 in good health out of which 830 survived, 100 in poor health out of which 30 survived
Hospital B - 600 in good health out of which 590 survived, 400 in poor health out of which 210 survived

Interestingly, the survival rates of the patients having poor health is 52.5% in B and 30% in A. Amazingly, the survival rates of the patients having good health is 92.22 % whereas the same for Hospital B is 98.33%. Turns out that Hospital B is a clear winner and convincingly too.

The above is an example of Simpson's paradox which occurs when the aggregated data hides a conditional variable, which is hidden additional factor that significantly influences results.

Simpson's paradox isn't hypothetical. You can look at Mark Liddel's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxYrzzy3cq8 "Video"). 

The above is one of the many things about statistics which I found very fascinating. By the way I am Param Khakhar, currently a Computer Science and Engineering Sophomore studying at the Indian Institution of Technology, Delhi. Being a CSE student, I have been introduced to several interesting areas where CS is used but personally, I like the usage of algorithms for the increased understanding of stats, in other words Data Science. Consequently, I do spend time learning stuff online apart from college academics. 

I come from Rajkot, Gujarat, India. My hobbies include playing sports, watching soccer [Manchester is blue ;)], listening to music, dance etc.
