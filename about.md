**Hi!**

I am Param, currently a Computer Science and Engineering Sophomore studying at the Indian Institution of Technology, Delhi. Being a CSE student, I have been introduced to several interesting areas where CS is used but personally, I like their use in finding patterns in the ever-increasing data, in other words Data Science. Consequently, I do spend time learning stuff online apart from college academics. 

I come from Rajkot, Gujarat, India. My hobbies include playing sports, watching soccer [Manchester is blue ;)], listening to music, dance etc.
