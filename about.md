Hey there!

Welcome to this corner of the web crafted by yours truly. Admittedly, things have been a bit quiet around here, but fear not â€“ change is on the horizon!

Currently immersed in the world of quantitative trading post my computer science undergrad stint, my gaze is fixed on the activities at the Dalal Street.

What can you expect here? Well, it's a mishmash of my experiences, musings on sports (cricket and football are my jam), navigating the intriguing world of stock markets, sharing the latest reads and podcast gems, and perhaps a sprinkle of my own whimsical takes on this wild ride we call life.

Join me as I unravel the intricacies of my journey, scribble down my thoughts, and throw in a few curveballs just for fun.

Cheers
