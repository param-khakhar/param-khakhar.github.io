I"\<p>This is a live page and would contain my reviews of the books which I’ve read. Please DM me for other interesting books! I used to read books, when I was younger but discontinued due to other interests. However, the time at which this article is written resulted in resumption of this activity :P.</p>

  <li><strong>Indulekha</strong> by <em>O.Chandumenon</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This one I read as a part of my Humanities Course, Rise of Novel, where in the main theme was to study the initial novel as new literary texts along with the factors that lead to it’s rise. This was one of the first novels published in India, written around 1890s or so.</li>
      <li>The main protagonist Indulekha, did receive an English education (British India) as opposed to other women around her and with her used to highlight the importance of English Education, especially for women. Interestingly, it was the first time that I got to know about the matrilineal society which used to exist in the Malabar region, before the British introduced measures against it.</li>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari</strong> by <em>Robin Sharma</em>
    <ul>
      <li>A very good book indeed as it throws light on something very much fundamental, our existence, and our purpose. It introduced me with several other aspects of life, such as spiritual success which is quintessential in my point of view in the coming years. The aim of the book is to help people balance things in general.</li>
      <li>The author suggests several activities, practices which one should carry out in order to have a peaceful existence. I was very motivated to inculcate all of them in my routine, but gradually ended up doing only a few of them and I’m afraid haven’t been doing any of them lately! Although doing only a few of them and not all would be significant.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>The Alchemist</strong> by <em>Paulo Coelho</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This was something which was a bit difficult to understand, but was able to somehow join connections. It is a very good attempt by the author to answer questions such as purpose of your living and spirituality.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>The Palace of Illusions</strong> by <em>Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This novel is a description of the Mahabharata from Draupadi’s point of view. What I found very good about this description is that it is very neutral. There aren’t any biases which might be the case if you read any articles on history.</li>
      <li>The presentation is very subtle and lucid. It clearly depicts the traditional (typical) Indian society and the stereotypes. You’d certainly, learn about different moral values which you may inculcate in general for a happy and peaceful living.</li>
    </ul>
