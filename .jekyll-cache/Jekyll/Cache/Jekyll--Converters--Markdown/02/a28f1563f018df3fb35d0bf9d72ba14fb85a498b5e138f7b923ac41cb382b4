<p>Have you ever wondered what happens when you press the power button of your PC? Well, it does end up in a screen asking you for your credentials! But, what actually leads to this? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>We can divide this process into 6 main intermediate steps. These are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>BIOS</li>
  <li>Master Boot Record (MBR)</li>
  <li>GRUB</li>
  <li>Kernel</li>
  <li>Init</li>
  <li>Run Level</li>
</ol>

<p>What do these terms mean in the first place? Let’s find out that as well.</p>

<h2 id="bios">BIOS</h2>

<p><strong>BIOS</strong> stands for <strong>B</strong>asic <strong>I</strong>nput <strong>O</strong>utput <strong>S</strong>ystem, and it is a <strong>firmware</strong>. Now, this is different from the usual hardware and software which you might have heard of. Firmware is a software which resides on a dedicated memory chip, which is close to the metal (hardware). Software is used for programs that reside on hard disks, and use the functionality of the Operating System, in order to interact with the hardware, but firmware on the other hand doesn’t need to do so. It directly accesses the hardware. An example of that would be your TV remote, which processes your inputs (button presses) to generate the corresponding infrared signals.</p>

<p>BIOS is one such firmware for our computer. It resides on a chip inside the computer’s <strong>motherboard</strong>. A motherboard is a printed circuit board, which essentially connects all the computer hardware such as the RAM, hard drives, optical drives and the CPU. On pressing the power button, the BIOS runs what is known as <strong>POST</strong>, which stands for <strong>P</strong>ower <strong>O</strong>n <strong>S</strong>elf <strong>T</strong>est. This is basically a check which is performed by the BIOS which ensures that whether all the hardware devices such as the monitor, keyboard, mouse along with storage devices, processor, memory,etc, are working correctly or not. If the test turns out to be unsuccessful, further steps don’t proceed, unless the problem is fixed. Doing so, the hardware kind of initializes the hardware for further use. It then proceeds to search and execute the bootloader.</p>

<p>In CS jargon, the word <strong>booting</strong> is used to denote the process of starting the computer. The <strong>bootloader</strong> is a program which is responsible for loading the Operating System itself in the RAM. The bootloader is present on what is known as a <strong>bootable device</strong>, now this could be a floppy disk, USB, hard disk etc. A bootable device is one which contains a sector (512 byte sized division), whose last two bytes contain the <strong>boot signature</strong>. This is <strong>0x55</strong> and <strong>0xAA</strong>, which are represented in hex. The decimal counterparts are <strong>85</strong> and <strong>170</strong>, respectively. Such a sector containing the boot signature is known as the <strong>boot sector</strong>. However, in order for bootloader to execute, it needs to be loaded onto the memory initially and then executed. This work is done by the BIOS and the <em>Master Boot Record</em>.</p>

<h2 id="master-boot-record">Master Boot Record</h2>

<p>The Master Boot Record is a kind of boot sector which is the first sector of a disk. The BIOS loads the Master Boot Record from a disk. A particular setting of BIOS allows users to order the disks from which the MBR is to be loaded. Thus, the BIOS loads the MBR from the first device which contains the boot signature, as the boot signature may get corrupted.</p>

<p>The MBR comprises of three important components, which are:</p>

<h3 id="partition-table">Partition Table</h3>

<p>The partition table contains an index of upto 4 partitions of the disk. Note MBR, is a sector of a disk and it isn’t present on disks which aren’t partitioned (such as floppy disks). It occupies 64 bytes of space.</p>

<h3 id="bootstrap-code">Bootstrap Code</h3>

<p>The <em>Primary Boot Loader</em>, it occupies 446 Bytes of space. Now, 446 Bytes of space is small, very small, in order to load the entire OS. With such constraints, the primary boot loader can only load the next (secondary) bootloader, and execute it. The secondary bootloader would be present in one of the four partitions, and</p>

<p>The famous 0x55AA, which takes 2 bytes and therefore, the</p>
